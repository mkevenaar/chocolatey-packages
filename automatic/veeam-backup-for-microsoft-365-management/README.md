Microsoft 365 provides powerful services within Office 365 — but a comprehensive backup of your Office 365 data is not one of them. **Veeam® Backup _for Microsoft 365_** eliminates the risk of losing access and control over your Office 365 data, including Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams — so that your data is always protected and accessible.

Veeam Backup _for Microsoft 365_ gives you the power to securely backup Office 365 to any location — on-premises or in cloud object storage — including Amazon S3, Azure Blob, IBM Cloud or S3 compatible providers on premises.

This package installs the following software by default:

* Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 Console
* Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 PowerShell
* Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Exchange
* Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Sharepoint
* Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Teams
