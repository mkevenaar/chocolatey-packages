This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>One music sequencer for all major platforms, desktop and mobile</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[## ![helio-workstation example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/helio-fm/helio-workstation@30a8ba6b1ab4d5421887dce9fc0eae77e3c266fc/Resources/screen-v2.png)

[Helio Workstation](https://helio.fm) is free and open-source music sequencer, designed to be used on all major platforms.

## Why another sequencer

Most of the DAW interfaces often seem [overcomplicated](http://mashable.com/2015/09/18/german-u-boat/), and they only tend to get more and more bloated over time. Many of them are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none of them support all major operating systems at the same time.

Helio is an attempt to rethink a music sequencer to create a tool that **feels right**.

It aims to be a modern music creation software, featuring linear-based sequencer with a clean interface, high-performance C++ core, integrated version control providing intelligent synchronization between devices, saved undo history, translations to many languages and more.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know [here](https://github.com/mkevenaar/chocolatey-packages/issues) that the package is no longer updating correctly.
