This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <description><![CDATA[Exit when reboot detected

When installing / upgrading these packages, I would like to advise you to enable this feature `choco feature enable -n=exitOnRebootDetected`

## Veeam Backup Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365)

Microsoft 365 provides powerful services within Office 365 — but a comprehensive backup of your Office 365 data is not one of them. **Veeam® Backup _for Microsoft 365_** eliminates the risk of losing access and control over your Office 365 data, including Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams — so that your data is always protected and accessible.

Veeam Backup _for Microsoft 365_ gives you the power to securely backup Office 365 to any location — on-premises or in cloud object storage — including Amazon S3, Azure Blob, IBM Cloud or S3 compatible providers on premises.

This package is used as a dependency by other Chocolatey packages. To install any of the tools, please use one of the other packages.
