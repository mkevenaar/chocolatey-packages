This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <description><![CDATA[Exit when reboot detected

When installing / upgrading these packages, I would like to advise you to enable this feature `choco feature enable -n=exitOnRebootDetected`

## Veeam Service Provider Console Self-Service Portal APIs for Veeam Agents

In _Veeam Service Provider Console_, you can restore files and folders to their initial location or download restored data to your computer. When you perform a file-level restore, Veeam Service Provider Console displays the backup content in the **file-level restore portal**. You can browse the guest OS files and folders, restore them to original location and overwrite or keep original objects or download ZIP archive with restored objects to your computer. When you restore guest OS files and folders, Veeam Service Provider Console connects to the Veeam backup agent installed on remote computer which performs the restore process.

### Package Parameters
