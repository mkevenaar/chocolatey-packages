Rocrail is free software for controlling model trains for Linux, Apple macOS, Raspberry Pi & Odroid and of course Windows operating systems.

Rocrail assumes all responsibilities for controlling a model railroad and their accessories. Trains can be either manually controlled or completely controlled by the software in automatic mode. A mixed operation, i.e. controlling some trains manually and other trains in fully automatic mode is possible.

Nightly builds are snapshots and it is recommended to save your last working revision in case it will not work for you.
Using this program is at your own risk. Robert Jan Versluis can not be held responsible for any damage that the use of this program may cause to your computer, model trains or anything else. To prevent problems it is strongly recommended to first read the Manual.
