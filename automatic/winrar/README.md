## WinRAR

WinRAR is a powerful archive manager. It can backup your data and reduce the size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format.

You can find themes for WinRAR [here](http://www.rarlab.com/themes.htm).

### Commercial software

You can try WinRAR before you [buy](https://shop.win-rar.com/16/purl-shop-1984-1-n).

### Package Parameters

The following package parameters can be set:

* `/LCID:` - the language code you want to install - defaults to your current language
* `/English:` - force English language to install

To pass parameters, use `--params "''"` (e.g. `choco install packageID [other options] --params="'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2 /FLAG_BOOLEAN'"`).
To have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.
