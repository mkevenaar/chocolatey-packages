## Spark

Spark is an Open Source, cross-platform IM client optimized for businesses and organizations. It features built-in support for group chat, telephony integration, and strong security. It also offers a great end-user experience with features like in-line spell checking, group chat room bookmarks, and tabbed conversations.

Combined with the Openfire server, Spark is the easiest and best alternative to using un-secure public IM networks.
