Veeam® Agent for Microsoft Windows provides a simple solution for backing up Windows-based servers, desktops and laptops. With Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows, you can easily back up your computer to an external hard drive, NAS (network-attached storage) share or a Veeam Backup and Replication™ repository. And, should ransomware encrypt your files, your system fails to boot, your hard drive crashes or an important file gets corrupted or accidentally deleted, you can recover what you need in minutes — like it never happened.
