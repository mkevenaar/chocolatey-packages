## ENJOY PRODUCTIVE JAVA

Every aspect of IntelliJ IDEA is specifically designed to maximize developer productivity.

Together, the powerful static code analysis and ergonomic design make development not only productive but also an enjoyable experience.

## Deep intelligence

After IntelliJ IDEA has indexed your source code, it offers a blazing fast and intelligent experience by giving relevant suggestions in every context: instant and clever code completion, on-the-fly code analysis, and reliable refactoring tools.

## Out-of-the-box experience

Mission-critical tools such as integrated version control systems and a wide variety of supported languages and frameworks are all to hand — no plugin hassle included.
