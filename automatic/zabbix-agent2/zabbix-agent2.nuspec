<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Zabbix Agent v2, MSI installer for Windows</summary>    
    <description><![CDATA[This package installs the Zabbix agent MSI from the [pre-compiled files](https://www.zabbix.com/download_agents) supplied by [Zabbix LLC](https://www.zabbix.com/). The source code for this Chocolatey package can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix-agent-chocolatey). Please file any issues you find in the project's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix-agent-chocolatey/issues).

## Package installation defaults

By default, **installation** of this package:

* Will install the OpenSSL version of the Zabbix agent to "%ProgramFiles%\Zabbix Agent".
* Will set the hostname to $env:COMPUTERNAME.
* Will set the server to 127.0.0.1.
* Will add firewall rules.
* Will *NOT* enable encryption.
* Will *NOT* enable remote commands.

**Please Note**: To have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set:

```powershell
choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`
```

## Package Parameters

A full list of configuration options is available in the [Zabbix documentation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/installation/install_from_packages/win_msi#command-line-based-installation).
Here are some of the most commonly used:

* `SERVER` - List of comma delimited IP addresses (127.0.0.1).
* `SERVERACTIVE` - IP:port (or hostname:port) of Zabbix server or Zabbix proxy for active checks ($SERVER).
* `HOSTNAME` - Unique, case sensitive hostname ($env:COMPUTERNAME)
* `INSTALLFOLDER` - Full pathname specifying where the Zabbix agent should be installed (%ProgramFiles%\Zabbix Agent).
* `ENABLEPATH` - Add Zabbix agent to the PATH environment variable (0).
* `SKIP` - Passing "fw" to this parameter will skip adding the firewall exception rule.
* `ALLOWDENYKEY` - Sequence of "AllowKey" and "DenyKey" parameters separated by ;. Use \\; to escape the delimiter.

These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `--params`.

### Examples

`choco install zabbix-agent2 --params '"/SERVER:<Zabbix Server IP>`
`choco install zabbix-agent2 --params '"/SERVER:192.168.6.76 /SERVERACTIVE:192.168.6.76 /HOSTNAME:zabbix-agent-1.zabbix.com /ALLOWDENYKEY:AllowKey=system.run[*] /SKIP:fw"'`

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know [here](https://github.com/mkevenaar/chocolatey-packages/issues) that the package is no longer updating correctly.
