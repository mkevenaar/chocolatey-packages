When installing / upgrading these packages, I would like to advise you to enable this feature `choco feature enable -n=exitOnRebootDetected`

## Recovery tool for Oracle

Veeam® Explorer™ for Oracle delivers low recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) with agentless transaction log backup and transaction-level recovery of Oracle databases — so you can restore your Oracle database to a precise point in time, even to a specific database transaction.
