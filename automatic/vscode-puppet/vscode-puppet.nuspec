<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

- Open Symbol by Name
- Linting
- Live Workspace Intellisense
- Code snippets
- Go to Definition of functions, types and classes
- Validation of `metadata.json` files
- Import from `puppet resource` directly into manifests
- Node graph preview
- Puppet Development Kit integration
- (Experimental) Local debugging of Puppet manifests
- (Experimental) Docker Language Server support

**It is currently in technical preview, so that we can gather bug reports and find out what new features to add.**

### Supported Puppet Versions

The Puppet Extension for VSCode works with Puppet 4 or higher. Some features will be slower or not work on Puppet 4, and are noted in the section for that feature. See [open source Puppet](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/about_agent.html) and [Puppet Enterprise](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2017.3/getting_support_for_pe.html#supported-puppet-enterprise-versions) lifecycle pages for version support details.

### Requirements

You will need to have the [Puppet Agent](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/4.10/about_agent.html)  or [Puppet Development Kit (PDK)](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/1.x/pdk.html) installed in order to fully use this extension.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
