<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
    <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <description><![CDATA[## JetBrains YouTrack

The issue tracker designed for agile software teams

### ALL IN ONE

A project management tool that can be adapted to your processes to help you deliver great products. Track tasks and bugs, plan sprints and releases, create workflows, and customize YouTrack for your business processes. Never force your process to fit the limits of a tool again. Unlike other issue trackers, YouTrack can be customized to your needs!

### Be Agile

#### Agile Boards

YouTrack lets you configure an Agile Board for any process you can dream up. Use the Agile boards to support you with your Scrum, Kanban, and mixed processes.

Be Agile your way - create boards with multiple projects, add swimlanes based on user stories, epics, deadlines, or any other fields. See the changes that are applied to the board or in the backlog in real time.

#### Planning

Plan the future of your project development with the flexible backlog. Create user stories, feature requests and tasks. Don’t switch between tabs - open the backlog right from the board, edit it and move issues to the sprint.

### Monitor the progress of your product

#### Reports

Keep track of your project, team, and personal progress using dozens of predefined reports. See how your issues are distributed over the projects, assignees, and priorities. Check on how you are progressing over time using the timeline reports. Track the estimated and the actual time spent on various activities.

#### Dashboards

Get an overview of your projects using multiple dashboards and share them with your team. Place reports, markdown notes, and issue lists as widgets or create your own widgets if you're in need of more data!

#### Time Management

Use time management on a per project basis to control the estimated and actual time spent on various activities by each team member and over the whole team. Create time reports and share them with the stakeholders and customers. Plan ahead with your project activities using a Gantt Chart and track your progress as you go, making sure you stay on schedule.

### Bring IDE-style intelligence to your issue tracking

#### Smart search

Never get lost in your issues! Find things quickly using the smart search with auto-completion.
For example, `#YouTrack -{Board YouTrack} #unresolved assigned to: me sort by: priority` will find you the unresolved issues that are not on the board assigned to you and will sort the results based on priority. See, how intuitive!

#### Commands and shortcuts

Modify multiple issues quickly and efficiently using commands. Speed up your routine operations using shortcuts just like you would in your favorite IDE. Save time and stay focused on what's important.

### Import your projects, users, and issues from Jira and other trackers

Move from [Jira](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/standalone/importing-from-jira.html) to YouTrack with one click! Using other trackers? [Check out](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/standalone/Migrating-to-YouTrack.html) all the migration options.
Move to YouTrack and get 25% discount off for any commercial plan!

#### Payed software

This software is free to use for teams up to ten (10) users, for larger teams a [license](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/buy/#edition=standalone) from JetBrains is required.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
