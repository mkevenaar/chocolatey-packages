## Description

Bacula is a set of computer programs that permits the system administrator to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer data across a network of computers of different kinds. Bacula can also run entirely upon a single computer and can backup to various types of media, including tape and disk.

Due to its modular design, Bacula is scalable from small single computer systems to systems consisting of hundreds of computers located over a large network.
