## Description

## Microsoft Visual Studio Live Share

Visual Studio Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real time, regardless what [programming languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/platform-support#visual-studio-code) you're using or app types you're building. It allows you to instantly (and [securely](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/security)) share your current project, and then as needed, share [debugging sessions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode#co-debugging), [terminal instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode#share-a-terminal), [localhost web apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode#share-a-server), [voice calls](https://aka.ms/vsls-audio), and more! Developers that join your sessions recieve all of their editor context from your environment (e.g. language services, debugging), which ensures they can start productively collaborating immediately, without needing to clone any repos or install any SDKs.

Additionally, unlike traditional pair programming, Visual Studio Live Share allows developers to work together, while retaining their personal editor preferences (e.g. theme, keybindings), as well as having their own cursor. This allows you to seamlessly transition between [following one another](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode#following), and being able to explore ideas/tasks on your own. In practice, this ability to work together _and_ independently provides a collaboration experience that is potentiallty more natural for many [common use cases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/use-cases).
