<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
    <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <description><![CDATA[DEPRECATED!

    The Intel® SSD Toolbox will reach End of Maintenance with no additional updates after September 2020. Intel® recommends that users migrate to the Intel® Memory and Storage Tool (GUI) as a replacement for Intel® SSD management and firmware updates.

    SSD drive management software that allows you to:

- View current drive information for Intel® Solid-State Drives (Intel® SSDs), including:
  - Model number, capacity, and firmware version
  - Drive health
  - Estimated drive life remaining
  - SMART attributes (also available for hard disk drives and non-Intel SSDs)
  - IDENTIFY DEVICE information (also available for hard disk drives and non-Intel SSDs)
- Optimize the performance of an Intel SSD using Trim functionality
- Optimize the performance of an Intel SSD in RAID 0 using Trim functionality Intel® Rapid Storage Technology (Intel® RST) 11.0 or greater. NOTE: Trim on RAID 0 is not supported on Windows 8* or Windows Server 2012
- Obtain proactive notifications of new Intel SSD Toolbox software versions for Windows 7 and Windows 8 systems
- Update the firmware on a supported Intel SSD
- Run quick and full diagnostic scans to test the read and write functionality of an Intel SSD
- Check and tune your system settings for optimal Intel SSD performance, power efficiency, and endurance
- View your system information and hardware configuration, such as central processing unit (CPU), chipset, controller name, and driver versions
- Run Secure Erase on a secondary Intel SSD

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know [here](https://github.com/mkevenaar/chocolatey-packages/issues) that the package is no longer updating correctly.
